THIS IS A TEMPLATE FOR THE PROJECTS (YOU CAN CHANGE STUFF)

There are 2 package.json files. 1 for the client-side and the other for the server-side.
MAKE SURE TO INSTALL BOTH BY GOING INTO EACH FOLDER IN THE COMMAND LINE.

Why did I choose for them to have separate package.json files?
It simplifies maintenance, dependency management, and development processes.
We could have 1, but it would make it too complicated (especially for when we make it to the testing phase).

CLIENT SIDE:

- Only thing that really needed to be included was the helpers.js for the testing phase.

SERVER SIDE:

- Routers, Models, and Controllers already have example files inside to follow naming conventions (e.g. if it's capitalised on first word or if it's plural or not)
- The Database folder has the set up in place. ONLY thing MISSING is the sql for the database.
